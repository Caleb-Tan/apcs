# The Flag Project

The aim of this project was to make a flag from java that is scalable and has the proportions of a realistic flag. In the project, there are 4 main files. **Main.java** is the class that creates the flag and frame objects, and makes the frame appear. **Flag.java** contains all the methods that paint the flag, where each part of the flag is painted in its separate method. **Flag.jar** is the executable jar file, and **README.md** is the readme that you are reading.
